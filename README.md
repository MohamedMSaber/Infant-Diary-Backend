People in their lives tend to expand their families by getting married and 
having babies, having a child is one of life’s great joys, but also it is one of the 
hardest challenges that a family will face because taking care of babies and their 
health is so difficult.
Difficulties like:
   • Feeding challenges
   • Diseases that threaten their health
   • Sleep schedules
   • Crying now and then
         
And these challenges change as they get older and older.
Also, these are not the only problems that families face when dealing with newborn 
babies, for example, some families live in new places where they are not familiar with 
the doctors in there and they need to reach out to a doctor for an emergency, booking 
an appointment sometimes can consume a lot of time which is not necessary, changing 
a doctor also may be helpful if the first doctor is not experienced enough, also being up 
to date with all the vaccines and injections needed for the baby is crucial.


Objectives:-

By the end of the project, we should have achieved our goal which is helping 
the parents raise the born babies, helping the parents in taking care of them, and 
making their lives much easier also, helping the doctors follow up with the family.
